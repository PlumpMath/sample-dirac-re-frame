## Distribution

Distributable files with be placed within `docs/` where GitHub pages look them for.

## Documentation

## Development

Technically, this project is a [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) rich single-paged application built upon [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) â€” wrapped into [Reagent](http://reagent-project.github.io/). I use [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel), [Dirac](https://github.com/binaryage/dirac) for development so I can enjoy [live-coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding). For the time being, this project is distributed within a [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/) : [https://piotr-yuxuan.github.io/sample-dirac-re-frame/](https://piotr-yuxuan.github.io/sample-dirac-re-frame/)
